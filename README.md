[![Build](https://github.com/4SV-Studio/The-Point-Of-No-Return/actions/workflows/gradle.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/4SV-Studio/The-Point-Of-No-Return/actions/workflows/gradle.yml)

Core mod for our modpack, works standalone too!

---

World is now covered with concentrated time, after the timeline was erased. 
It fills your body, no living creature can outstand that power. 

But there's a crystal that can absorb the time around it. 
Use hazmat suit and filters to protect yourself from endless suffering of experiencing concentrated time.

Explore apocalyptic world around you, and remember _**TIME**_'ve got eyes.

## About modpack
It will always be **forge only**

## About mod
Currently it's **only for forge**, BUT **fabric port is planned** after the final release. Thought, only mechanics will be ported, not bunker

## About updates
Every mod update will also be a modpack update. Big releases will stop after all planned features will be added, only small updates and bug fixes will be released after that
