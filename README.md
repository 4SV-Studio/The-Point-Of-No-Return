# The Point of No Return
[![Build](https://github.com/4SV-Studio/The-Point-Of-No-Return/actions/workflows/gradle.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/4SV-Studio/The-Point-Of-No-Return/actions/workflows/gradle.yml)

Core mod for our modpack, works standalone too!

---

The world is now covered with concentrated time, after the timeline was erased. \
It fills your body, no living creature can outstand that power. 

But there's a crystal that can absorb the surrounding time. \
Use a hazmat suit and filters to protect yourself from endless suffering from experiencing concentrated time.

Explore the apocalyptic world around you, and remember _**TIME**_'ve got eyes.
